# Description project ⭐

I developed a responsive website that displays various weather-related data, including humidity, temperature, forecasts, and a brief description of the current weather.
I incorporated a simple dark mode implementation using Tailwind and structured the project following atomic design principles, allowing for reusable components.
For the charts, I used Ngx-charts.
To handle errors, I created a dialog that shows an error message if the endpoint fails to load.
The project includes the API key I used, which is from 'https://openweathermap.org'.
